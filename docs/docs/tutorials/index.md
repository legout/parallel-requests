# Tutorials

Welcome to the tutorials section! These step-by-step guides will help you learn fastreq from the ground up, starting with installation and basic usage, and progressing to more advanced concepts.

## Tutorial Path

We recommend following the tutorials in order:

1. **[Getting Started](getting-started.md)** - Installation and your first parallel requests (~10 min)
2. **[Parallel Fundamentals](parallel-fundamentals.md)** - Understanding concurrency and async patterns (~15 min)
3. **[Handling Errors](handling-errors.md)** - Working with exceptions and error handling (~15 min)

## What You'll Learn

After completing these tutorials, you'll be able to:

- Install and configure fastreq
